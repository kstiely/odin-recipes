# Pre-OP
This project will create a basic recipe website containing recipes, links to other pages, and probably images as well.

This project will also be an exercise in using git and GitHub as well as practicing good commit messages and documentation

# Post-Op
I have succesfully created a website with a homepage and 3 additional recipe pages. I have included links to the pages as well as images for each of the dishes. I used my knowledge of boilerplate html code and elements such as headings, images, and ordered and unordered lists.
